									United Nations Security Council (UNSC) is one of the six main organs established under the UN Charter. The mandate of UNSC is to maintain international peace and security. While other organs can only give recommendations to member states, the Council has the power to make decisions that member states are obliged to implement under the Charter, implying that the Council could take further actions whenever peace is threatened.

									The situation in the Middle East has already been a crucial issue nowadays, the events seldom as fascinating to watch, as well as challenging to comprehend with news reports we receive from the region every day. One of the most notable issues in the region is terrorism. Though actions have been taken in this area, still more and more extreme terrorist groups are popping up, triggering incidents and causing insecurity around the world. To understand the situation of this region, we shall divide the problem into several different aspects and discuss.

									This year, unlike other regular MUN UNSCs, TWMUN made a UN4MUN approach on our UNSC committee. UN4MUN is so far the best simulation of the real UN. Delegates would be reaching consensus, working on all kinds of documents other than resolution in the UNSC, and experiencing the whole working procedure of the UNSC. We kindly welcome all the delegates to participate in our committee and discuss the issue in the Middle East.

									The Wizengamot is wizarding Britain's high court of law and parliament. The administrative headquarters are located in the Department of Magical Law Enforcement of the Ministry of Magic, while the trials take place in the dungeons of the lower levels. It has the function of a normal court and parliament combined. Laws and decrees are passed and sanctioned by the Wizengamot, and also wizard trials (similar to our muggle one with the defendants and barristers) are prosecuted in this committee.

									The United Nations Commission on the Status of Women(UNCSW) is held every year at the UN Headquarters, New York. Under the current methods of work, the Commission “addresses emerging issues, trends, focus areas and new approaches to questions affecting the situation of women, that require timely consideration” in each session. In this conference, we will be focusing our discussion on banning the long practiced Female Genital Mutilation (FGM), and moderating general principals for gender bias laws, policies and programmes to follow.
									FGM is a destructive operation practiced on female genitals mostly in African countries, which later put those women in great danger during labor or even between sexual interactions. According to WHO, 200 million women worldwide are affected by FGM. While there are plenty of countries working on making their laws and policies gender neutral, and some trying to secure women’s long oppressed rights through amending them, many countries are still inactive nor do they recognize the need to change current situation.
									The world has been witnessing the uprising voice of women everywhere. Yet, there are still women who remained silence. Sometimes, it’s simply because they don’t know they have a voice.
									We welcome both male and female delegates to participate in our committee, because we can’t achieve gender equality when only half of the world’s invited.

									The Disarmament and International Security Committee (DISEC) was established in 1993. It is the First and one of the main committees of the General Assembly. DISEC deals with issues regarding the promotion, establishment, and subsequent maintenance of global peace while simultaneously working to prevent weapons proliferation. The mandate of DISEC is stated under the United Nations Charter, “The General Assembly may consider the general principles of cooperation in the maintenance of international peace and security, including the principles governing disarmament and the regulation of armaments and may make recommendations with regard to such principles to the Members or to the Security Council or to both”.
									With the increase of weapons and growing security threats, DISEC continues to grow in importance and becomes a significant part of resolving international crises.

								<h3>Topic Introduction</h3>

								<h3>A.The Illicit Trade of Small Arms and Light Weapons</h3>
								<!-- <p>
								Confidence-building measures (CBMs) are planned procedures to prevent hostilities, to avert escalation, to reduce military tension, and to build mutual trust between countries. They have been applied since the dawn of civilization, on all continents. At present, too few military CBMs are in place. Many regions lack even the most basic military CBMs. In recent years, most conflicts have been based on either civil wars escalating to regional confrontations or distrust amongst states in the same region. To solve the issue of regional and sub-regional disarmament for both conventional and weapons of mass destruction, confidence must be built amongst all players in such regions. These regions include: The middle east with the Syrian civil war being at the forefront, attracting international outcry with the escalating number of persons killed and displaced; another region is the Asia Pacific with growing tension over North Korea. However, the confidence amongst these states and all other players in these region has been lacking. In this committee, we would like delegates to look into how we can be able to include different parties into one regional or sub-regional CBM. Moreover, focus is not based only on the above mentioned regions.
								</p> -->
								<h3>B. Cyber Warfare and the Role of Internet in Conflict</h3>
								<!-- <p>
								With the growing amount of military expenditure all over the world, the General Assembly in 1987 held a conference to discuss the relationship between Disarmament and Development. The conference defined the relationship between disarmament and development, examined the magnitude and consequences of military expenditure and technological advances on the world economy and on science, and explored ways to reallocate resources for civil development through disarmament. The dais in their collective experiences have always noticed that delegates in DISEC were very accustomed to talking about disarmament and nonproliferation, yet conversations regarding development were rarely debated. For example, although nuclear technology is controversial, it is rather cheap, and as such has paved way for various civil development for many developing countries in all regions of the world for means pertaining to not electricity generation, water purification, and fertilization; however, at the same time virtually all nuclear materials are capable of being weaponized, making the decision to utilize such technology a difficult dilemma. A very important and prevalent question now presents itself: How can the international and the scientific community restrict development of harmful technology and disarm them, but at the same time use the technology for civil development?

									UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, is a global organization dedicated to saving lives, protecting rights and building a better future for refugees, forcibly displaced communities and stateless people. Work to ensure that everybody has the right to seek asylum and find safe refuge, having fled violence, persecution, war or disaster at home.
									Since 1950, UNHCR has faced multiple crises on multiple continents, and provided vital assistance to refugees, asylum-seekers, internally displaced and stateless people, many of whom have nobody left to turn to. As an organization, which help to save lives and build better futures for millions forced from home.
									It elaborates five core directions on which UNHCR will focus – protection; responding in emergencies and beyond; promoting inclusion and self-reliance, including through the engagement of development actors; the empowerment of the people UNHCR serves; and the pursuit of solutions.
								</p>
								<!-- <h3>Topic Introduction</h3>

								<h3>A.	Protection of Children and Women from Sexual Violence and Prostitution</h3>
								<p>
									Sexual violence and prostitution have remained to be a significant challenge for all countries, whether developed or developing. Evidence shows that sexual violence can have serious impact on not only individuals, but also their families and communities. Children and women in many countries experience sexual violence and prostitution in a disturbing rate and are less likely to seek for help and support. The contributing factors included are not limited to culture, unsatisfactorily synergy between the police and prosecutors, and the careless trail procedures. Additionally, it is a well-known fact that in recent years, the development of internet and mobile phones also put children at risk of sexual violence as some adults look to the internet to pursue sexual relationships with children. The SOCHUM expects to play a prominent role in building up a more comprehensive guideline to solve the issues on hand. Furthermore, the discussion on the strengthening of protection systems at both national and local levels should take all countries’ perspectives into consideration in order to set up norms that can be efficiently followed by countries.
								</p>

								<h3>B.	Preservation of Cultures and Languages of Minorities</h3>
								<p>
									Along with common equality of all race and human prosperity, the concept that languages and cultures exist, evolve and, then sometimes, die is a basic tenet of modern development. Linguistics, cultural anthropologists, and cultural organizations are not concerned by the death of certain languages, generally, but by the rate at which those deaths are occurring. Significant proof reveals that more than half of the over 6,700 world languages are expected to die by 2100, with the speed ever increasing as the speakers originated from those certain cultures age overtime. Apart from the issues of international stability, the idea of actively preserving unique cultures has never shied away from the mandate of the committee of SOCHUM, as imperative as it is to keep biological diversity intangible as it should always be for global humanity. SOCHUM decides to play a preemptive decision-maker in this regard as we invite delegates to have a concrete dialogue on the role of minority languages in national culture and their merits for inclusion or exclusion thereof. There would be a couple of sub-topics in our greatest concern—identification of minorities of, reinstitution of linguistic oppression, alongside the expansion of protection for supporting cultures that are in possible extinction.
