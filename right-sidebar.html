								The Council for Security Cooperation in the Asia Pacific (CSCAP) is a committee with the responsibility of contributing towards regional confidence building and enhancing regional security through dialogues, consultations, and cooperation in the Asian Pacific region. There are currently twenty-one full members of the Council, providing a platform for intergovernmental communication, information exchange, and organizing various working groups to address challenges facing the region as well as to provide policy recommendations on political-security issues. Through the introduction of the crises during the session, delegates will be able to tackle more urgent issues in the Asia Pacific region.

								<h1>Topic Introduction</h1>
								<p>Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) remains one of the most repressive authoritarian states in the world. In an era of inflection and changes around the world, DPRK is seeking a greater status in a new global equilibrium. DPRK’s ever expanding nuclear arsenal, combined with its excessive claim of being threatened, have become a major security concern. To analyze both national and international security, there are a lot of complex realities that must be considered. Discussed approaches varied from export bans to military sanctions, yet only lowered tensions in the area permits progress on the human rights issues.<p>

								<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/pic03.jpg" alt="" /></a>
								<p>
								The Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) is one of the six main bodies of the United Nations. ECOSOC deals with economic, social, cultural and environmental challenges as well as human rights and fundamental freedoms. It also coordinates the works of the UN and the specialized agencies, such as World Bank, IMF, WHO, and FAO, and by coordinating the UN’s works on these topics, it’s aimed to enhance living conditions worldwide. In addition, about 70 % of the UN’s human and financial resources are managed by ECOSOC due to its broad spectrum of responsibilities. It serves as the central mechanism for the activities of the UN’s system and its specialized agencies and supervises the subsidiary and expert bodies in the relating fields. Therefore, the committee employs different special agencies and functional, regional commissions in order to accomplish its goals.

								<h1>Topic Introduction</h1>

								<h1>A.	Green energy and sustainable development</h1>
								<p>
									Although fossil fuels are the main energy sources nowadays, the situation can't be permanent since it may be exhausted and there’re numerous environmental impacts caused by the usage of it. Fossil fuels are finite, and the deposits that exist cannot be replenished within a short time after they are used. But when will these resources actually run out, however, is a tricky question since there are many different factors to be considered. Despite the factors mentioned above, we are sure that it will be exhausted in the near future, which means new energy resources that can replace fossil fuels are sorely needed, yet the balance between economic development and environmental protection should be taken into consideration as well. On the other hand, it becomes even more complicated when speaking of the use of nuclear power. This has been an ongoing debate within the international community, and it will be a part of our discussion as well.
								</p>
								<h1>B.	Resource allocation in Gaza strip</h1>
								<p>
									Countless military conflicts are taking place around the world, but what happens after the conflict ends is something people often overlook. Economic reconstructions are always one of the critical aspects in post-conflict zones, directly affecting whether or not the nation or area being returning to prosperous or going poor, and what the international community plans to do in these areas are definitely something worth discussion. Many conflicts had occurred in Gaza strip, and the nearest one is the Israel–Gaza conflict in 2014, which made the area’s status remain unstable. Instead of becoming the negotiator between the rival countries, it will be necessary for the international community to provide resources for reconstruction as well. Also, the allocation of the resources will be a critical factor as it may lead to the next conflict. But there are several types of resource, such as natural resources, healthcare resources, and security. UN will become a coordinator to allocate these resources. And if no country will be benefited by providing assistance, then resource allocation will only become a slogan. As a result, how to create a win-win situation to make all the countries involved will become a priority issue in this situation.

								<h2 class="committee_topic">DIESEC</h2>
								<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/pic03.jpg" alt="" /></a>
								<p>
								Formed in 1945, the First Committee on Disarmament and International Security (DISEC) serves as a forum for all 193 Member States of the United Nations, as well as for the international communities to deal with disarmament and related international security questions. The committee meets every year in October for a 4-to-5-week session, after the General Assembly General Debate. With DISEC being one of the six committees of the General Assembly, its resolutions are not legally binding to any of the Member States. Namely, it does not have the authority to forbid Member States from carrying out initiatives, impose sanctions, or authorize armed intervention. Therefore, the main objective of the committee is to propose recommendations to the Security Council, other UN organs, as well as other Member States. Furthermore, there are several offices and organizations the committee cooperates directly with, including the United Nations Office for Disarmament Affairs (UNODA), the United Nations Office at Geneva, the Conference on Disarmament, the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), and the United Nations Disarmament Commission. DISEC, with its focus on international security, has faced several issues since its inception. With 193 countries attending the annual meeting of DISEC last October, the Committee continues working on making progress in providing security, peace, and stability for peoples of the world.

								<h1>Topic Introduction</h1>
								<p>
								Confidence Building Measures in Regional and Sub-Regional Disarmament

								Confidence-building measures (CBMs) are planned procedures to prevent hostilities, to avert escalation, to reduce military tension, and to build mutual trust between countries. They have been applied since the dawn of civilization, on all continents. At present, too few military CBMs are in place. Many regions lack even the most basic military CBMs. In recent years, most conflicts have been based on either civil wars escalating to regional confrontations or distrust amongst states in the same region. To solve the issue of regional and sub-regional disarmament for both conventional and weapons of mass destruction, confidence must be built amongst all players in such regions. These regions include: The middle east with the Syrian civil war being at the forefront, attracting international outcry with the escalating number of persons killed and displaced; another region is the Asia Pacific with growing tension over North Korea. However, the confidence amongst these states and all other players in these region has been lacking. In this committee, we would like delegates to look into how we can be able to include different parties into one regional or sub-regional CBM. Moreover, focus is not based only on the above mentioned regions.
								The Relationship Between Disarmament and Development

								With the growing amount of military expenditure all over the world, the General Assembly in 1987 held a conference to discuss the relationship between Disarmament and Development. The conference defined the relationship between disarmament and development, examined the magnitude and consequences of military expenditure and technological advances on the world economy and on science, and explored ways to reallocate resources for civil development through disarmament. The dais in their collective experiences have always noticed that delegates in DISEC were very accustomed to talking about disarmament and nonproliferation, yet conversations regarding development were rarely debated. For example, although nuclear technology is controversial, it is rather cheap, and as such has paved way for various civil development for many developing countries in all regions of the world for means pertaining to not electricity generation, water purification, and fertilization; however, at the same time virtually all nuclear materials are capable of being weaponized, making the decision to utilize such technology a difficult dilemma. A very important and prevalent question now presents itself: How can the international and the scientific community restrict development of harmful technology and disarm them, but at the same time use the technology for civil development?

								<h2 class="committee_topic">SOCHUM</h2>
								<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/pic03.jpg" alt="" /></a>
								<p>
								The Third Committee of the General Assembly, generally known as the Social, Humanitarian & Cultural Committee (SOCHUM), concentrates its mandate on handling issues with regard to humanitarian affairs and social development. The committee focuses on the promotion of global literacy, the exaltation of fundamental freedoms, the protection of cultural heritage and the elimination of all forms of discrimination, just to name a few. Since the establishment of United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) in 2006, SOCHUM had delegated a portion of its responsibilities to its sub-committee, which reports back to the GA on matters related to human rights. Furthermore, unlike Security Council resolutions, resolutions passed within a General Assembly are not legally binding; however, they have historically served to motivate member states to adopt stances and to undertake critical issues.
								</p>
								<h1>Topic Introduction</h1>

								<h1>A.	Green energy and sustainable development</h1>
								<p>
									Sexual violence and prostitution have remained to be a significant challenge for all countries, whether developed or developing. Evidence shows that sexual violence can have serious impact on not only individuals, but also their families and communities. Children and women in many countries experience sexual violence and prostitution in a disturbing rate and are less likely to seek for help and support. The contributing factors included are not limited to culture, unsatisfactorily synergy between the police and prosecutors, and the careless trail procedures. Additionally, it is a well-known fact that in recent years, the development of internet and mobile phones also put children at risk of sexual violence as some adults look to the internet to pursue sexual relationships with children. The SOCHUM expects to play a prominent role in building up a more comprehensive guideline to solve the issues on hand. Furthermore, the discussion on the strengthening of protection systems at both national and local levels should take all countries’ perspectives into consideration in order to set up norms that can be efficiently followed by countries.
								</p>

								<h1>B.	Preservation of Cultures and Languages of Minorities</h1>
								<p>
									Along with common equality of all race and human prosperity, the concept that languages and cultures exist, evolve and, then sometimes, die is a basic tenet of modern development. Linguistics, cultural anthropologists, and cultural organizations are not concerned by the death of certain languages, generally, but by the rate at which those deaths are occurring. Significant proof reveals that more than half of the over 6,700 world languages are expected to die by 2100, with the speed ever increasing as the speakers originated from those certain cultures age overtime. Apart from the issues of international stability, the idea of actively preserving unique cultures has never shied away from the mandate of the committee of SOCHUM, as imperative as it is to keep biological diversity intangible as it should always be for global humanity. SOCHUM decides to play a preemptive decision-maker in this regard as we invite delegates to have a concrete dialogue on the role of minority languages in national culture and their merits for inclusion or exclusion thereof. There would be a couple of sub-topics in our greatest concern—identification of minorities of, reinstitution of linguistic oppression, alongside the expansion of protection for supporting cultures that are in possible extinction.
