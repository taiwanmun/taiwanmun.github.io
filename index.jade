            p. 
              Model United Nations is a student conference with the aim of bringing the negotiations and experience of a real UN conference to life.
              Academically, we not only aim to simulate the United Nations and grant our delegates the opportunity to expand their global views and leadership talents, but also cultivate a new generation of young innovators ready to become the present of the future.

            h4 UNSC
            p United Nations Security Council (UNSC) is one of the six main organs established under the UN Charter. The mandate of UNSC is to maintain international peace and security. While other organs can only give recommendations to member states, the Council has the power to make decisions that member states are obliged to implement under the Charter, implying that the Council could take further actions whenever peace is threatened. The situation in the Middle East has already been a crucial issue nowadays, the events seldom as fascinating to watch, as well as challenging to comprehend with news reports we receive from the region every day. One of the most notable issues in the region is terrorism. Though actions have been taken in this area, still more and more extreme terrorist groups are popping up, triggering incidents and causing insecurity around the world. To understand the situation of this region, we shall divide the problem into several different aspects and discuss. This year, unlike other regular MUN UNSCs, TWMUN made a UN4MUN approach on our UNSC committee. UN4MUN is so far the best simulation of the real UN. Delegates would be reaching consensus, working on all kinds of documents other than resolution in the UNSC, and experiencing the whole working procedure of the UNSC. We kindly welcome all the delegates to participate in our committee and discuss the issue in the Middle East.

            h4 DISEC
            p The Disarmament and International Security Committee (DISEC) was established in 1993. It is the First and one of the main committees of the General Assembly. DISEC deals with issues regarding the promotion, establishment, and subsequent maintenance of global peace while simultaneously working to prevent weapons proliferation. The mandate of DISEC is stated under the United Nations Charter, “The General Assembly may consider the general principles of cooperation in the maintenance of international peace and security, including the principles governing disarmament and the regulation of armaments and may make recommendations with regard to such principles to the Members or to the Security Council or to both”. With the increase of weapons and growing security threats, DISEC continues to grow in importance and becomes a significant part of resolving international crises.

            h4 UNCSW
            p The United Nations Commission on the Status of Women(UNCSW) is held every year at the UN Headquarters, New York. Under the current methods of work, the Commission “addresses emerging issues, trends, focus areas and new approaches to questions affecting the situation of women, that require timely consideration” in each session. In this conference, we will be focusing our discussion on banning the long practiced Female Genital Mutilation (FGM), and moderating general principals for gender bias laws, policies and programmes to follow. FGM is a destructive operation practiced on female genitals mostly in African countries, which later put those women in great danger during labor or even between sexual interactions. According to WHO, 200 million women worldwide are affected by FGM. While there are plenty of countries working on making their laws and policies gender neutral, and some trying to secure women’s long oppressed rights through amending them, many countries are still inactive nor do they recognize the need to change current situation. The world has been witnessing the uprising voice of women everywhere. Yet, there are still women who remained silence. Sometimes, it’s simply because they don’t know they have a voice. We welcome both male and female delegates to participate in our committee, because we can’t achieve gender equality when only half of the world’s invited.
